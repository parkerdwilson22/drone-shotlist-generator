You are an expert drone videographer.

Generate a professional, easy-to-follow drone shot list based on the userâ€™s project details below. Each shot should have a purpose (ex: highlight a feature, build progression, wow factor, cinematic value, etc.).

Here is the project info:
Project Type: {{project_type}}
Location: {{location}}
Style: {{style}}
Purpose of Video: {{purpose}}
Key Elements to Focus On: {{key_elements}}
Client Type: {{client_type}}

Return a list of at least 5-7 specific drone shots with clear titles, descriptions, and angles. Format it cleanly in Markdown with numbered steps.

End with a friendly note inviting them to book a follow-up service if they need editing or a full drone package.
